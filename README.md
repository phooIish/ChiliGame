# The Chili Game
There is a jar filled with thirteen chocolates and a chili pepper. The user and cpu can only pick one to three chocolates per turn. Whoever has to take the pepper, loses.. the cpu never loses btw ;9)

# Issues:
1. [SOLVED = Line 40] P1 wins with first pick and by only taking 1 chocolate every turn.
2. [SOLVED = Line 110] CPU reacts the same no matter what P1 picks (cpu = 4 - p1).
3. [SOLVED = Line 108] If CPU goes first and P1 only takes 1 by 1, CPU will win after taking 6 chocolates - invalid move.
